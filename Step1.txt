To develop a Twitter Sentiment Analyzer using Naive Bayes, we need a dataset with tweets labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. Without such a dataset, we can't train a model to classify the tweets. However, we can still build a simple classifier based on the words used in the tweets.

Let's start by cleaning and preprocessing the tweets. We will remove the URLs, mentions, hashtags, and punctuation marks, and convert all the words to lowercase.
